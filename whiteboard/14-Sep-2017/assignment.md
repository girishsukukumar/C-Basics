# Assignement to be submitted on 19-Sep
* Implement strtok() function as discussed in the class, 
* Implement strlen() and strcpy() function.
* How to test all the above function :  Write a program which will make use of your implementation of strtok() like extracting token, now give the same input to the buildin function strtok() do the same from strlen() and strcpy()
* Study the behaviour of build in function strchr()  and implement it by yourself and test it against the buildin fucntion strch()
**Reading Assignment**
 * If you look at the prototype or signature of the following functions 
    * char *strtok(char *str, const char *delim)
    * char *strchr(const char *str, int c)
    * size_t strlen(const char *str)
    * char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src)
 * You will notice that the first or second  parameter of all these function is defined as **const char** find out what is significance of this keyword **const** in a function parameter or what difference does it makes when you mention the word **const** in the parameter list. You may need to google and or read text books to find the answer.
