# Assignement to be submitted on 19-Sep
1. Implement strtok() function as discussed in the class, 

1. Implement strlen() and strcpy() function.

1. How to test all the above function :  Write a program which will make use of your implementation of strtok() like extracting token, now give the same input to the buildin function strtok() do the same from strlen() and strcpy()

1. Study the behaviour of build in function strchr()  and implement it by yourself and test it against the buildin fucntion strch()

**Reading Assignment**
 1. If you look at the prototype or signature of the following functions 
    1. char *strtok(char *str, const char *delim)
    1. char *strchr(const char *str, int c)
    1. size_t strlen(const char *str)
    1. char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src)
    1. You will notice that the first or second  parameter of all these function is defined as **const char** find out what is significance of this keyword **const** in a function parameter or what difference does it makes when you mention the word **const** in the parameter list. You may need to google and or read text books to find the answer.
