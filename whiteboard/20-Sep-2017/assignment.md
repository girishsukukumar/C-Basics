# Assignment to be submitted on 21-Sep-2017

Using arrays we had written different type of C programs out which the most important once are  searching and sorting an array.
In this programs we had used array index eg a = array[i]. In this assignment you are requested to re-write those programs using 
pointers only and not to use array index
Eg: if you want want to access the first element of an array earlier we say x = array[0]

* now we say 
* ptr = array ;
* x = *ptr; 
* ptr++ ;
* x = *ptr ; // instead of saying array[1]
